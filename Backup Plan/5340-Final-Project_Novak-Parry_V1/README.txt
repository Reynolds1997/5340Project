TEAMMATES
Niko Novak (u1209211)
Evan Parry (U1000976)

CONTRIBUTIONS
Niko: ACQUIRED, ACQLOC, PURCHASER, SELLER slots.
Evan: Overall program architecture (input and output handling), ACQBUS, DLRAMT, STATUS slots. 

A roughly equal amount of work and thought was contributed by both teammates, even if some slots don't perform as well as others.
Both teammates met regularly to discuss ideas and plan out the overall system.

SCRIPT
Not needed (Python installs and compiles libraries on its own)

EXTERNAL LIBRARIES/RESOURCES
We used the spaCy NLP toolkit for NER and POS tagging purposes. https://spacy.io/
We used the data provided in order to build dictionaries for word recognition.

INSTRUCTIONS
Ideally, run this program on the CADE machine "lab1-9.eng.utah.edu"
Other CADE machines may work, but we have verified that this particular machine has spaCy installed in the home directory. 
This is the machine we've used for Linux development.

TIME TO RUN
In our tests, it took just a few seconds to test a single file (at maximum). 

LIMITATIONS
If python3 gives you trouble, try using python to execute it.
Not all slots are reliable. ACQUIRED, ACQLOC, PURCHASER, and SELLER in particular gave us trouble.
